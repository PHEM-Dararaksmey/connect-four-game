Gameplay:

Players take turns dropping their colored discs into the grid from the top.
Discs fall straight down and occupy the lowest available space in the chosen column.
The objective is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of their own discs.
Winning:

The first player to connect four discs in a row wins the game.
The game can also end in a draw if the grid is completely filled without either player achieving four in a row.
